                <h1>Turning Lines into Stories</h1>
                
                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a self-taught drawer based in Kolhapur, Maharashtra. My journey into art began unexpectedly, sparked by a pivotal moment of introspection. 
                </p>
                
                <h3>My Process & Inspiration</h3>
                <p>
                    My work is primarily focused on pencil and charcoal, as I am fascinated by the infinite range of emotions that can be conveyed through monochrome shades and textures. I find inspiration in the everydayâ€”the subtle expressions on a person's face, the play of light and shadow on old architecture, and the raw beauty of nature. Each piece is a meditation, a slow and deliberate process of building layers to bring an idea to life.
                </p>

                <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    Through my art, I aim to capture and explore the quiet narratives that exist within a single moment. My goal is to create images that are not just seen but felt, inviting the viewer to pause and connect with the story held within the lines.
